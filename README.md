# Algorithms
C code for some common algorithms

## Compiling
All of the algorithms compile using gcc
```
gcc filename.c
```
## Input
I will try to include the types of input in the header comment, but all files use command line argments.
Execute using ./a.out plus some input. Example:
```
a.out 1 2 3 4
```
## About
These algorithms were created during an analysis of algorithms course at the University of Idaho.
